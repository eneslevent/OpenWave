This is data taken from the BN055 9 Degrees of Freedom IMU device.

The format is as follows:

linaccel x, linaccel y, linaccel z, euler x, euler y, euler z, mag x, mag y

linaccel = linear acceleration (acceleration with gravity removed)
euler    = euler angles for x,y, and z axes
mag      = magnetometer values for x and y axes
